> [!TIP]
> **New!** Strix now integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines. Automatically scan for vulnerabilities on every pull request and block insecure code before it reaches production!

## 🦉 Strix Overview

Strix are autonomous AI agents that act just like real hackers - they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them through actual proof-of-concepts. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without the overhead of manual pentesting or the false positives of static analysis tools.

- **Full hacker toolkit** out of the box
- **Teams of agents** that collaborate and scale
- **Real validation** with PoCs, not false positives
- **Developer‑first** CLI with actionable reports
- **Auto‑fix & reporting** to accelerate remediation

---

### 🎯 Use Cases

- Detect and validate critical vulnerabilities in your applications.
- Get penetration tests done in hours, not weeks, with compliance reports.
- Automate bug bounty research and generate PoCs for faster reporting.
- Run tests in CI/CD to block vulnerabilities before reaching production.

---

### 🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- Docker (running)
- Python 3.12+
- An LLM provider key (or a local LLM)

```bash
# Install
pipx install strix-agent

# Configure AI provider
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run security assessment
strix --target ./app-directory
```

First run pulls the sandbox Docker image. Results are saved under `agent_runs/<run-name>`.

## 💻 Usage Examples

```bash
# Local codebase analysis
strix --target ./app-directory

# Repository security review
strix --target https://github.com/org/repo

# Web application assessment
strix --target https://your-app.com

# Multi-target white-box testing (source code + deployed app)
strix -t https://github.com/org/app -t https://your-app.com

# Test multiple environments simultaneously
strix -t https://dev.your-app.com -t https://staging.your-app.com -t https://prod.your-app.com

# Focused testing with instructions
strix --target api.your-app.com --instruction "Prioritize authentication and authorization testing"

# Testing with credentials
strix --target https://your-app.com --instruction "Test with credentials: testuser/testpass. Focus on privilege escalation and access control bypasses."
```

### ⚙️ Configuration

```bash
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Optional
export LLM_API_BASE="your-api-base-url"  # if using a local model, e.g. Ollama, LMStudio
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # for search capabilities
```

### 🤖 Headless Mode

Run Strix programmatically without interactive UI using the `-n/--non-interactive` flag—perfect for servers and automated jobs. The CLI prints real-time vulnerability findings, and the final report before exiting. Exits with non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found.

```bash
strix -n --target https://your-app.com --instruction "Focus on authentication and authorization vulnerabilities"
```

### 🔄 CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Strix can be added to your pipeline to run a security test on pull requests with a lightweight GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: strix-penetration-test

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Strix
        run: pipx install strix-agent

      - name: Run Strix
        env:
          STRIX_LLM: ${{ secrets.STRIX_LLM }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}

        run: strix -n -t ./
```
