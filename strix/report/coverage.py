"""``coverage.json`` — the negative space of a scan, with provenance.

A findings list answers "what is wrong". It cannot answer "what did you
check", and in a compliance context that second question is the one that
decides whether a clean result means anything: an auditor reading zero SQL
injection findings cannot tell "tested fourteen endpoints, all parameterized"
apart from "never looked".

This module assembles the artifact that answers it. Two kinds of statement go
in, and they are kept apart on purpose:

- ``agent_reported`` — the coverage ledger (:mod:`strix.tools.coverage.tools`).
  Rich and specific, but it is an agent's account of its own work.
- ``machine_observed`` — facts the runtime recorded regardless of what any
  agent claimed: which agents ran and how they terminated, which skills they
  carried, how many findings were filed, whether the run finished or was cut
  short.

A coverage claim is an attestation, so conflating the two would be the worst
possible failure: a hallucinated "tested and clean" is strictly less honest
than no coverage record at all. Every entry therefore carries its ``source``,
and machine-observed facts contradict rather than confirm — an agent that
carried the ``sql_injection`` skill and recorded nothing about SQL injection
shows up under ``gaps``, and a run that hit its budget ceiling is stamped
``complete: false`` no matter how tidy the ledger looks.
